# Detecting mild cognitive impairment with oral dysfunction
Using elders' dental and emotion examination data to predict elders' mild cognitive impairment. The detecting model is able to predict the disease with high sensibility under an extremely imbalanced data distribution. In addition to predicting cognitive impairment, the follow-up research can discover crucial features through visualization of embedding layer and feature engineering of LightGBM. This method provides practical suggestion for the application of clinical diagnosis in the future.

Main skills to use:
- Dealing with imbalanced data with different sampling methods
- A deep learning model to handle high-dimensional features with different data types
- Using LightGBM to do the feature engineering and give proper explanation of the final result
- Visualizing the embedding of training features to do further analysis
